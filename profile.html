            <h2>Mikko Vuopala</h2>
            <p>
                Hello!
                <br><br>
                My name is Mikko Vuopala. I am currently studying information networks in Aalto University.
                I finished my bachelors degree last summer (2021), and since then I have continued with my masters studies.
                I have been focusing on the more technical side of our study programme and that way I have grown my interest
                in programming and software development.
                <br><br>
                From very young age I have been very interested in sports and nowadays I am a bit of a sport enthusiast. In
                elementary school as well as in high school I spent most of my free time playing soccer or basketball. Within those sports I have
                been able to develop my team working skills and brcome better team member as well as team leader.

                <br><br>
                I have always been quick to learn new things and I think that being able to learn and adapt to new situations quickly is one
                of my strongest skills. Other than that I enjoy problem solving tasks and I have a lot of perseverance to push through more difficult
                tasks also (I like to get things done).

            <h3><span>Microsoft</span>, Lab operator</h3>
            <h4>05/2021 - 08/2021</h4>
            <p>
                Last summer, I got to work at Microsoft HoloLens as a lab operator. As a lab operator my tasks consisted mainly of operating and monitoring of manufacturing machines.
                The tasks required a  lot of attention and I got to develop my problem solving skills whenever an error occurred during the process. The work also developed my skills
                in working under pressure since we had daily and weekly production goals that we had to achieve. During the summer I got the responsibility to substitute our senior operator during his
                summer leave.

                In 2019, I worked at Posti (the Finnish Post) as a mail clerk. My tasks consisted mostly of sorting and delivering the mail. The work required precision and great time management
                skills so that all mail would get delivered to the right persons in time. During my time at Posti I got the responsibility to train and guide a couple of new employees to the job.
